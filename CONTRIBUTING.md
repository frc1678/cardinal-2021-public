### Review norms
- To get a PR merged, you need at least one review from a contributor
- Approval messages should be clear and concise (e.g. "Looks good.", "Review")
- PRs should pass all tests. If a test is broken, add that as a bug report

### Assignment norms
- Before something is being worked on, make an issue for it
- Issues should be split between contributors

### Working norms
- In an issue, explain your initial ideas for the PR
- Preferably only start work when other PRs you're working on are ready for review, or they are blocked by something

### Discussion norms
- Discussions will happen both in person, and on the [Discussion Page](https://github.com/JakeRoggenbuck/Cardinal/discussions)
- We will try to put every decision made and discussion summary on Github, along with any drawings made at an in person meeting

### Code Style
- We use a format checker to keep style consistent
- To check code, run this
```
black . -S -l 100 --check
```
